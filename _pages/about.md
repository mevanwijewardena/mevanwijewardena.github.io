I am a Ph.D. student in Electrical Engineering at the University of Southern California (USC), [Viterbi School of Engineering](https://viterbischool.usc.edu/), advised by Professor [Michael J. Neely](https://viterbi-web.usc.edu/~mjneely/). I am broadly interested in optimization, game theory, and networks. Currently, I am intereseted in stochastic control problems with partial feedback, with emphsis on aspects such as fairness between agents, adaptiveness of the algorithms, and information asymmetry among agents. 

Before joining USC, I completed my Bachelor's Degree in Electronic and Telecommunication Engineering at the University of Moratuwa, Sri Lanka. My undergraduate advisors were Professor Tharaka Samarasinghe, [Dr. Subodha Charles](https://www.subodhacharles.net/) and Dr. Kasun Hemchandra.
