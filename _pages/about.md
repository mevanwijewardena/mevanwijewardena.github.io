I am a Ph.D. student in Electrical Engineering at the University of Southern California (USC), [Viterbi School of Engineering](https://viterbischool.usc.edu/), advised by Professor [Michael J. Neely]([https://link-url-here.org](https://viterbi-web.usc.edu/~mjneely/). I am broadly interested in optimization, game theory, and networks. Currently, my focus is developing online algorithms with strong theoretical guarantees for the problems of utility maximization and queue stability in networks where users have access to partial information about the environment. I am also interested in game theory problems with partial information and assymmetric information between agents. 

Before USC, I completed my Bachelor's Degree in Electronic and Telecommunication Engineering at the University of Moratuwa, Sri Lanka. My undergraduate advisors were Dr. Tharaka Samarasinghe, Dr. Subodha Charles and Dr. Kasun Hemchandra.
