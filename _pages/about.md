I am a Ph.D. student in Electrical Engineering at the University of Southern California (USC) advised by Professor Michael James Neely. My research interests span stochastic optimization, game theory. In particular, I am interested in the applications of stochastic optimization and game theory in communications problems. I am also interested in problems in information theory.

Before USC, I completed my Bachelor's Degree in Electronic and Telecommunication Engineering at the University of Moratuwa, Sri Lanka. My undergraduate advisors were Dr. Tharaka Samarasinghe, Dr. Subodha Charles and Dr. Kasun Hemchandra.
