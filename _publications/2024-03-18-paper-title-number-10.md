## Abstract

This report considers the problem of finding the asymptotic connectivity probability of cell partitioned networks. We specialize on the cases of 2D and 3D square and cubic networks. For the square
2D networks, we fully characterize the relationship between the asymptotic connectivity probability and
the cell density. For 3D networks we partially characterize the above relationship
