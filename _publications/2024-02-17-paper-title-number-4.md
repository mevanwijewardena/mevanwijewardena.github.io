## Abstract

We present MAGHair, a novel wearable technique that provides subtle haptic sensation by stimulating the body hair without touching the skin. Our approach builds on previous research in magnetic hair stimulation and magnetic locomotion. We use magnetic cosmetics to augment the body hair, which can then be stimulated by a wearable apparatus that combines electromagnets and permanent magnets. We provide technical insights on the implementation of a fully functional wrist-worn form factor and early adaptations into other form factors. In addition, we provide a workflow for evaluating and characterizing the magnetic cosmetic recipes. Finally, we evaluate MAGHair, which demonstrated that users could detect the sensation of hair movement that they described as gentle and unique.
