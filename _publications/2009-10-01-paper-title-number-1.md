## Abstract
This letter investigates the exploitation of an intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) to communicate securely in a two-way network consisting of an untrusted user. In particular, the transmit powers and the phase shift at each element of the IRS are optimized to maximize the sum-secrecy rate, such that the IRS-reflected and non-IRS-reflected signals are added destructively at the untrusted user. The proposed iterative algorithm converges rapidly to a feasible solution of high accuracy with a few iterations. Numerical results demonstrate sum-secrecy rate gains up to 120% compared to naive or partially optimized schemes.
